# BGGStats

=== Retired ===

A simple set of files to download and display stats from BGG using a Raspberry Pi.
The project intends to be a complete guide to installing and running this setup on a Raspberry running Raspbian and containing enough information to run it on Debian and Ubuntu.
The scripts download a number of XML files, connect them to transforms to display various data and copy them to a directory on the web server.
